This project is a recreation of a prior incarnation of an amazon web scraper. Previously, I would enter the links to track, but I want to make it so that all I have to do is enter a product name and then the program will iterate over several products to find the best deal. It will then store the information in a database for later retreival and comparison. Email notifications will be sent when a better deal is found. User authentication will be implemented.
